# Skill: Cold Call Script Builder

## What This Skill Does

Builds a complete cold and warm calling system for B2B sales — including opening hooks, permission-based bridges, qualification questions, objection responses, gatekeeper navigation, and voicemail scripts. Outputs ready-to-use scripts tailored to your ICP and offer, not generic templates. Designed for real calls: short sentences, natural rhythm, easy to say out loud. Most reps fail on the phone because they over-pitch and under-listen. This skill fixes that.

## When to Use

- Your team is doing outbound phone calls and scripts feel flat, robotic, or are getting rejected immediately
- You're cold calling a new ICP or persona and need a fresh script built for their language and pain
- You want to build a warm calling sequence (following up on a downloaded resource, event attendance, or intent signal)
- Your connect rate is okay but your conversion to meeting is low — the script needs fixing
- You have SDRs or BDRs who need a scalable call structure they can customize without being rigid
- You're doing a calling blitz and want fast, high-quality scripts ready to go

## Inputs Required

Before running this skill, ask the user for:

1. **Your offer** — what are you selling, and what is the core outcome you deliver? (one sentence)
2. **ICP details** — who are you calling? Title, industry, company size, and the most likely pain they're experiencing
3. **Call goal** — what does a successful call look like? (book a discovery call, get to a demo, reconnect a cold lead, qualify for a proposal)
4. **Warm signal (if applicable)** — did they download something, attend an event, open emails, or trigger intent? Or is this fully cold?
5. **Common objections on the phone** — what are the top 3 things prospects say to get off the call? (e.g., "send me an email," "not interested," "we already have a solution")
6. **Your differentiator in one line** — what's the one thing that makes you different from everyone else calling this persona?
7. **Example customer wins** — a quick reference to a result you've gotten for a similar customer (used for social proof in the script)

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1 — Build the Opening Hook (First 10 Seconds)

The opening is everything. Most cold calls die in the first 10 seconds because the rep sounds like every other cold caller. The hook must:
- Sound like a human, not a script
- Not pitch anything in the first sentence
- Signal immediately that you know something about their world
- Create enough curiosity that the prospect wants to hear the next sentence

**Three opening frameworks — pick one per ICP:**

**Framework A — The Pattern Interrupt (best for senior buyers who hate being sold to):**
"[Name], I know you weren't expecting this call — I'll be upfront: this is a cold call. Do you have 30 seconds before you decide whether to hang up?"

*(This works because it's the opposite of what they expect. Most senior buyers say yes out of curiosity or respect the directness.)*

**Framework B — The Specific Observation (best for accounts you've researched):**
"[Name], I was looking at [company] this morning — I noticed [specific signal: you're hiring for X, you recently expanded into Y, your team just hit Z milestone]. I'm calling because we work with a lot of [similar companies / titles] dealing with [the pain that signal implies], and I wanted to see if that's something on your radar."

**Framework C — The Common Ground Opener (best for warm leads or event contacts):**
"[Name], [your name] here from [company] — we connected briefly at [event] / you downloaded our guide on [topic] last week. I wasn't sure if [the pain it addressed] was something actively on your plate right now or more of a future priority — so I figured a quick call was easier than 10 back-and-forth emails."

Write all three versions for the specific ICP provided. The rep picks the one that fits the context of each call.

### Step 2 — Build the Permission Bridge

After the opening hook, do not pitch. Ask permission to continue. This step separates reps who get 4-minute conversations from reps who get hung up on after 20 seconds.

**Permission bridge template:**
"I don't want to take more of your time than you're willing to give — do you have 2 minutes? If what I share isn't relevant, just tell me and I'll let you go."

**Variation for very senior buyers:**
"I'll be quick — if what I say doesn't land in 2 minutes, feel free to cut me off."

**Why this works:** It signals confidence, respects their time, and psychologically reduces resistance. Most people say yes when you give them an easy out.

### Step 3 — Build the Value Statement (30 Seconds)

Once permission is granted, deliver one crisp value statement. This is not a feature pitch. It's a business outcome statement that connects directly to their known pain.

**Value statement formula:**
"We work with [ICP description] who are dealing with [specific pain]. We help them [outcome] — typically in [timeframe]. The reason I'm calling is [specific relevance to this person or company]."

**Example for a sales coaching company calling VP Sales:**
"We work with VP Sales at SaaS companies between 20 and 200 people who are struggling to get their mid-tier reps performing consistently — they've got 2 or 3 stars but the rest of the team isn't hitting quota. We help them close that gap without hiring more senior reps. Typically teams see the middle of the distribution move within 90 days. The reason I'm calling [Company] specifically is that you're at about 60 people and you just posted 3 new AE roles — that's usually when this problem gets harder to ignore."

### Step 4 — Build the Discovery Question Bridge

After the value statement, do not close for the meeting immediately. Ask one sharp question that either confirms or disinvites relevance. This does two things: it shows you're not just pitching, and it qualifies them in one move.

**Discovery question bridge formula:**
"Is that something that's actively on your radar right now, or is it more of a background noise thing?"

**Alternatives:**
- "Does that land, or is that not where your head is right now?"
- "Is [pain you described] a real priority for you in Q[X], or is this the wrong time?"
- "On a scale from 'we're managing it fine' to 'this is keeping me up at night' — where does [pain] sit for you?"

These questions do not pressure. They invite honesty. A "we're managing it fine" answer gives you information and an opening. A "yeah, this is a real issue" answer is your green light.

### Step 5 — Build the Meeting Close

Once you've confirmed relevance, close for the next step. Keep it simple and make the ask feel small.

**Meeting close template:**
"It sounds like it's worth a proper conversation. I'm not going to pretend a 30-minute call is going to solve everything — but it should be enough for both of us to figure out whether there's something worth exploring. Are you free [Day 1] or [Day 2] this week?"

**If they're hesitant:**
"I understand — the last thing you need is another vendor call. What I'd suggest is a 20-minute no-agenda call where I ask you a few questions and you ask me a few, and we both decide at the end if it makes sense to go further. Low risk. Would that work?"

**Always offer two specific time options.** Open-ended "when are you free?" almost always kills momentum.

### Step 6 — Build the Objection Handling Sequences

Write a full response sequence for each common phone objection:

**"Send me an email."**
Step 1 — Agree and reframe: "I can absolutely do that. Before I do — just so I send you something actually worth reading — can I ask you one quick question? [Ask your discovery question.] That way the email isn't just a PDF that sits in your inbox."
Step 2 — If they still say send an email: "Perfect — I'll send it over today. Is there a specific challenge you'd want me to address in it, or should I just send our overview?"
*(Getting a specific challenge = partial qualification. Now the email has a hook.)*

**"Not interested."**
Step 1 — Acknowledge and probe: "Fair enough — can I ask what's behind that? Is it the timing, or is [the pain you described] just not a priority right now?"
Step 2 — If timing: "Got it. When would be a better time to check back — Q[X+1], or after [event/trigger]?"
Step 3 — If genuinely not relevant: "Appreciate you being straight with me. Would it make sense to reconnect in 6 months, or should I take you off my list?"
*(Never push after a confirmed 'not relevant.' You want to leave the door open, not annoy them.)*

**"We already have a solution."**
Step 1 — Respect the existing investment: "That makes sense — most companies your size do. Can I ask who you're using?"
Step 2 — Acknowledge the competitor: "Good choice. How's it working for you?"
Step 3 — Find the crack: "What's the one thing you wish it did better, if anything?"
*(Most people with an existing solution have one thing that bugs them. That's your opening.)*

**"I'm too busy right now."**
"I completely understand — I wouldn't be calling if I didn't think this was worth 2 minutes of your time. What if we scheduled a call for [specific date 2–3 weeks out] when things settle down a bit? I'll put it in the calendar and if something comes up, just let me know — no hard feelings."

**"Who gave you my number?"**
"Your contact info is publicly available — I found it through [LinkedIn / your company website / our database]. I do my research before calling so I'm not wasting your time. Is this a bad time?"

### Step 7 — Build the Gatekeeper Navigation Script

For accounts with gatekeepers (assistants, office managers, receptionists):

**Opening:**
"Hi — [Your Name] calling for [Target Name]. I'm reaching out about [one-sentence description that sounds like business, not a pitch — e.g., 'a conversation about their sales team's growth plans this year']. Is [Target Name] available?"

**If asked "what is this regarding?":**
"I'm reaching out to [Target Name] about [specific business topic that their role owns]. It's regarding [a brief, specific hook — e.g., 'a partnership we've had success with at companies similar to theirs']. Could you let them know I called, or is there a better time to reach them directly?"

**What not to say to gatekeepers:**
- Never say "it's a personal matter" — they know it isn't, and it destroys trust
- Never say "it's regarding an account" unless it's true — false urgency backfires
- Never ask "is this a good time?" — this invites "no"
- Never give a long pitch — the gatekeeper is not the buyer

### Step 8 — Build the Voicemail Script

Voicemails should be 20–25 seconds. No more. The goal is not to explain your offer — it's to get a callback or create name recognition for your follow-up email.

**Voicemail template:**
"[Name], this is [Your Name] from [Company]. I'm reaching out because [one-line relevant hook — company context or pain]. I'll keep it short — I'll send you an email too, but if you'd rather just talk, my number is [number], spoken slowly twice. Hope to connect."

**The rule for voicemail:** Always follow a voicemail with an email within 15 minutes. Reference the voicemail: "I just left you a short voicemail — figured email might be easier." This multi-channel touch dramatically increases callback rates.

## Output Format

Deliver:

1. **Opening Hooks** — three versions (Pattern Interrupt, Specific Observation, Common Ground) tailored to the ICP
2. **Permission Bridge** — one standard + one variation for senior buyers
3. **Value Statement** — customized for the specific offer and ICP pain
4. **Discovery Question Bridge** — 3 question variants for the ICP
5. **Meeting Close** — standard close + hesitation-handler with two time options
6. **Objection Handling Sequences** — full response sequences for the top 5 phone objections
7. **Gatekeeper Script** — opening, "what is this regarding" response, and what not to say
8. **Voicemail Script** — 20–25 second script + follow-up email timing guidance

## Pro Tips

- Read your script out loud before calling. If it sounds like something a human would never say, rewrite it. The test is: would you say this to someone at a networking event? If no, it's too formal.
- The best cold calls are conversations, not performances. The script is a safety net — use it to get comfortable, then put it down and listen. The rep who asks the best questions wins, not the one with the most polished pitch.
- Batch your calls. Calling in focused 45-minute blocks beats scattered calls throughout the day. Your energy, tone, and confidence are higher in a batch and prospects can feel it.
- Call at the right time. B2B cold call connect rates peak at 8–9am and 4–5pm in the prospect's local time zone. Avoid 12–1pm — most people are at lunch or in meetings.
- When a prospect says "send me an email" and you do — make that email a direct reference to what you talked about, not a canned sequence. "As promised after our quick chat" performs 3x better than a generic nurture email.
- Track your call metrics weekly: dials, connects, conversations, meetings booked, and no-shows. If your connect rate is fine but conversion to meeting is low — the script is the problem. If both are low — the list is the problem.

## Example Output Snippet

**ICP:** VP of Sales at B2B SaaS, 30–150 employees, outbound-focused team

**Opening Hook — Pattern Interrupt Version:**
"[Name], I know you weren't expecting this — this is a cold call. I'll be straight with you: I'm going to pitch you in about 25 seconds. Do you have that long before you decide if it's worth your time?"

**Value Statement:**
"We work with VP Sales at SaaS companies your size who've got a solid top of funnel but are seeing too many deals stall between first meeting and proposal. We help them fix the qualification and follow-up process so more of those early-stage deals either convert or die quickly — instead of living in the pipeline as false hope. Teams typically see their stall rate drop within one quarter. The reason I'm calling [Company] is you're scaling your team right now, and that's exactly when this problem tends to get expensive."

**Discovery Question:**
"Does that resonate — is deal stalling a real issue for you right now, or are you mostly happy with where the pipeline sits?"
