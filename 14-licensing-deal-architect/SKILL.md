# Skill: Licensing Deal Architect

## What This Skill Does
Structures, prices, and sells IP or product licensing agreements — including software licenses, methodology licenses, content licenses, and brand licenses. Builds the deal model, negotiation framework, and sales narrative for licensing conversations with potential licensees, from initial pitch to signed agreement.

## When to Use
- You want to license your product, IP, framework, or methodology to other companies
- A company has approached you about using your technology or brand under license
- You want to create a recurring revenue stream without building a direct sales team
- You're exploring white-label, OEM, or platform licensing opportunities
- You want to expand into new markets through licensed distribution

## Inputs Required
Before running this skill, ask the user for:
1. **What is being licensed** — software, methodology, content, brand, data, API, or combination?
2. **Why would someone want to license it** — what's the value to the licensee?
3. **Target licensee profile** — who would buy this license? (company type, size, industry)
4. **How they would use it** — resell it, use it internally, integrate it, white-label it?
5. **Your pricing model idea** — flat fee, per-seat, revenue share, royalty, or hybrid?
6. **Any existing licensing conversations** — what's been proposed or discussed?

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1 — Define the Licensing Model
Choose the right structure based on what's being licensed and how:

**Model A — Flat License Fee**
Best for: Clearly bounded use (defined territory, time period, use case)
Structure: One-time payment or annual renewal for defined rights
Example: "$150,000/year for the right to use and train on [Methodology] within [Company] globally"

**Model B — Per-Seat / Per-User License**
Best for: Software or tools used by defined number of users
Structure: Fixed fee per user per month/year, with tier thresholds
Example: "$X/user/month up to 100 users; $Y/user for 101–500; volume pricing above that"

**Model C — Revenue Share / Royalty**
Best for: When licensee will sell to end customers (white-label, resell)
Structure: % of revenue generated from licensed IP
Example: "8% royalty on all revenue generated using the licensed framework"

**Model D — OEM / Embedded License**
Best for: Technology embedded inside the licensee's product
Structure: Annual platform fee + per-unit or per-seat fee
Example: "$50K/year platform access + $X per end-user seat activated"

**Model E — Hybrid Model**
Best for: Large enterprise deals where multiple value streams exist
Structure: Upfront access fee + ongoing royalty + renewal
Example: "$200K setup fee + 5% of gross revenue from licensed products"

### Step 2 — Calculate Licensing Value and Pricing
Price the license by anchoring to the licensee's upside:

**Value-Based Pricing Framework:**
```
Step 1 — Estimate licensee's revenue opportunity:
"If [Company] licenses this and sells it to their customers, what could they earn?"
Example: 1,000 end customers × $500/year = $500,000/year potential revenue

Step 2 — Set your royalty rate at 10–20% of their upside:
At 10% → $50,000/year
At 15% → $75,000/year

Step 3 — Add a minimum guarantee:
"We require a minimum of $[X]/year regardless of sales volume"
This protects your revenue floor and ensures they're motivated to sell.

Step 4 — Structure the upfront:
Implementation / onboarding / training fee = $[X] one-time
This reduces your risk if they don't execute.
```

**Price Anchoring Table:**
```
| Licensee Size   | Deal Range         | Typical Structure |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| SMB (< $5M rev) | $5K–$25K/yr       | Flat annual fee   |
| Mid-market      | $25K–$150K/yr     | Flat + min rev share |
| Enterprise      | $150K–$1M+/yr     | Flat + royalty + minimum guarantee |
| Strategic/Global| Custom            | Hybrid with territory exclusivity |
```

### Step 3 — Define the License Scope
Every licensing agreement must clearly define:

**What IS included:**
- Specific IP, code, methodology, brand elements being licensed
- Territory (country, region, or global)
- Duration (1 year, 3 years, perpetual with renewal)
- Use rights (internal use, resale, white-label, embed)
- Sub-licensing rights (can they license to their own clients?)

**What is NOT included:**
- Source code ownership (licensed, not transferred)
- Modifications or derivative works (unless specified)
- Use in competing products
- Transfer to third parties without approval
- Use outside the defined territory

### Step 4 — Build the Licensing Sales Pitch
Position the license as a revenue or strategic opportunity for the licensee, not just as a purchase:

**The Licensing Value Pitch:**
```
"[Company], your clients are already dealing with [problem your IP solves]. Right now, you either refer them elsewhere or leave it unaddressed — both options cost you revenue and retention.

By licensing [Your IP], you can offer this directly to your clients as part of your core service. You keep the client relationship, you generate new revenue, and you strengthen your competitive position.

Here's what the economics look like: [simple model showing their upside]. Our licensing program is designed to make this profitable for you from day one."
```

**The Strategic Fit Narrative:**
```
"We've built [IP] over [X years] through [proof point — customers, data, R&D]. It would take you [time and cost estimate] to build something equivalent — and you'd still be behind where we are today.

Licensing gives you access to everything we've built, your brand on top, and a time-to-market that's immediate."
```

### Step 5 — Navigate Common Licensing Objections

**"We'd rather build it ourselves"**
```
"That's a valid option. Let me give you a real picture of what that looks like: [build cost + time estimate]. And while you're building, your competitors who license faster will have 12–18 months of advantage in market. Is that a trade-off worth making?"
```

**"We want exclusivity"**
```
"Exclusivity is something I can discuss — at the right price. Exclusivity means we're forgoing other partnerships in [territory/market], so we'd need to price that appropriately. What territory or market are you thinking about, and what commitment would you be willing to make?"
```

**"Can we see the source code / methodology before we commit?"**
```
"I can share enough for you to evaluate the quality and fit — under NDA. Full access to [protected IP] comes with the signed license. We protect our IP in the same way you'd protect yours."
```

**"The royalty rate is too high"**
```
"Let's talk about that. The royalty is based on your upside — if you sell more, it's still 10% of more. What's your concern — is it cash flow in the early period, or the long-term rate?"
→ If cash flow: Offer a reduced rate in year 1, ratcheting up
→ If long-term: Set a royalty cap (once they pay $X total, rate drops)
```

### Step 6 — Licensing Deal Checklist
Before sending any licensing proposal, confirm:
```
[ ] License scope clearly defined (what's in, what's out)
[ ] Territory defined (global, regional, country-specific)
[ ] Pricing model chosen and calculated
[ ] Minimum revenue guarantee included
[ ] Term and renewal conditions clear
[ ] Exclusivity terms (if applicable) priced and agreed
[ ] Sub-licensing rights addressed
[ ] IP ownership clearly retained by licensor
[ ] Audit rights included (right to verify royalty calculations)
[ ] Termination conditions defined
```

## Output Format
Deliver:
1. Recommended Licensing Model (with rationale)
2. Value-Based Pricing Calculation (licensee upside + your fee)
3. License Scope Definition (what's included and excluded)
4. Licensing Sales Pitch (ready to use)
5. Objection Handlers (for the 4 most common)
6. Deal Checklist (pre-proposal)

## Pro Tips
- Exclusivity is the most valuable thing you can offer a licensee — and the most dangerous thing to give away cheaply. Always price it at 2–3x the standard fee and require a meaningful minimum guarantee.
- The best licensing deals are ones where the licensee is more motivated to make it work than you are — their skin in the game (via minimums) drives execution
- Always retain audit rights in royalty deals — licensees underreport without them
- Structure license fees with an annual escalation clause (e.g., 3–5% CPI increase) to protect against inflation
- A licensing deal is a long-term relationship — pick licensees as carefully as you pick employees
