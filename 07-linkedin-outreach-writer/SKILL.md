# Skill: LinkedIn Outreach Writer

## What This Skill Does
Writes personalized, non-salesy LinkedIn connection requests, first messages, follow-ups, and InMails that get replies. Uses prospect research and trigger events to craft outreach that feels human, relevant, and worth responding to.

## When to Use
- You need to write a connection request for a specific prospect
- You have a new connection you want to move toward a conversation
- Your current LinkedIn messages aren't getting replies
- You need to scale personalized outreach without sounding templated

## Inputs Required
Before running this skill, ask the user for:
1. **Prospect name, title, and company**
2. **One personalization detail** — a trigger event, something they posted, a mutual connection, or company news
3. **What you sell** — one sentence on the core problem you solve
4. **Goal of this outreach** — connection, conversation, or meeting?
5. **Tone preference** — casual and direct, warm and conversational, or executive-level?

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1 — Select the Outreach Type
Determine which message type is needed:

| Situation | Message Type |
|-----------|-------------|
| Not yet connected | Connection Request (300 chars max) |
| Just connected (day 0–3) | First Message (value or curiosity) |
| Connected, no reply after 5 days | Follow-up 1 (different angle) |
| Connected, no reply after 10 days | Follow-up 2 (soft close or break-up) |
| Paying for InMail | InMail (longer, more context) |

### Step 2 — Write the Connection Request
Rules:
- Max 300 characters
- Reference ONE specific detail (not generic)
- No pitch, no "I'd like to add you to my network"
- End with a reason to connect that benefits them

**Formula:** `[Specific observation] + [Why connecting makes sense] + [No ask]`

**Templates by trigger type:**

*Trigger: They posted something*
```
Hi [Name], your post on [topic] caught my attention — especially [specific point]. I work in [adjacent space] and think about this a lot too. Would love to connect with someone thinking this way.
```

*Trigger: Company news*
```
Hi [Name], congrats on [news — funding/launch/hire]. I work with [similar companies] at this stage. Would love to be in your network as you scale.
```

*Trigger: Job change (new role)*
```
Hi [Name], congrats on the new role at [Company]! First 90 days as [Title] are always full. Thought it would be worth connecting — I work with folks navigating similar transitions.
```

*Trigger: Mutual connection*
```
Hi [Name], [Mutual Name] suggested I reach out — we both work in [space]. Would love to connect and compare notes.
```

### Step 3 — Write the First Message (Post-Connection)
Send 24–48 hours after they accept. Never pitch. Add value or open curiosity.

**Formula:** `[Warm opener] + [Value or insight] + [Soft question or offer]`

**Templates:**

*Value Drop:*
```
Hey [Name], glad to be connected! I've been working on [relevant topic] a lot lately and put together [resource/insight]. Given what you're building at [Company], thought it might be useful. Happy to share — want me to drop it here?
```

*Curiosity Opener:*
```
Hey [Name], something I've been wondering — how are you thinking about [relevant challenge] right now at [Company]? I've been talking to a lot of [title] and seeing some interesting patterns. Curious if it maps to your experience.
```

*Insight Share:*
```
Hey [Name], one thing I keep seeing with [title] at companies like [Company]: [specific insight or pattern]. Does that resonate with what you're seeing, or is your situation different?
```

### Step 4 — Write the Follow-Up Sequence
If no reply in 5–7 days:

**Follow-up 1 — New Angle:**
```
Hey [Name], wanted to follow up — not sure if my last message got buried. [New angle or new piece of value]. Wondering if [question that invites a reply].
```

**Follow-up 2 — Soft Close (Day 10–12):**
```
Hey [Name], I'll keep this short — I don't want to keep pinging you if the timing isn't right. If [problem you solve] isn't a priority right now, totally understand. But if it is, happy to jump on a quick call. Either way, no worries — I'll let you be.
```

### Step 5 — Write the Meeting Ask
Once there's a back-and-forth conversation, make the ask:

**Low-friction meeting ask:**
```
[Name], based on what you've shared — this feels like it could be worth a quick conversation. Would 20 minutes make sense to explore? Not a sales pitch — just want to see if there's something real here. What's your calendar like [day] or [day]?
```

**Calendly-style ask:**
```
Would it be easier if I just dropped a link? Here's mine — grab whatever works: [Calendly link]
```

## Output Format
Deliver:
1. Connection Request (ready to copy-paste, under 300 chars)
2. First Message (post-connection, value or curiosity)
3. Follow-up 1 (if needed)
4. Follow-up 2 / Soft Close (if needed)
5. Meeting Ask (when ready)

All messages personalized with the details provided. Each clearly labeled and ready to send.

## Pro Tips
- The first message sets the tone for the entire relationship — make it about them, not you
- If your connection request acceptance rate is below 35%, your target is wrong or your message is too salesy
- The best follow-up is a NEW insight or angle, not "just checking in" — that's a conversation killer
- Never ask for a meeting in a connection request — it's the LinkedIn equivalent of proposing on a first date
- Short messages outperform long ones 4:1 on LinkedIn — get to the point fast
- Always end messages with a question or a clear action — open loops keep conversations alive
