# Skill: Strategic Partner Finder

## What This Skill Does
Identifies, qualifies, and builds an outreach strategy for strategic partnerships — technology integrations, channel partners, referral partners, co-selling agreements, and distribution deals. Generates a prioritized partner target list, partnership value proposition, and outreach sequences tailored to each partner type.

## When to Use
- You want to build a partner channel to extend your sales reach
- You need co-selling partners who can bring your solution into their deals
- You're looking for technology integration partners to strengthen your product
- You want referral partners who earn by recommending you to their clients
- You need distribution partners to reach markets you can't access directly

## Inputs Required
Before running this skill, ask the user for:
1. **Your product/service** — what you sell and the core problem it solves
2. **Your ICP** — the customers you're trying to reach through partners
3. **Partnership type goal** — co-sell, referral, technology, distribution, or all?
4. **What you can offer a partner** — revenue share %, co-marketing, leads, product access, certifications?
5. **Any partners you've already explored** — what worked, what didn't?

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1 — Define the Partner Profile
Just like an ICP for customers, build an Ideal Partner Profile (IPP):

**Ideal Partner Profile Template:**
```
Partner Type: [Co-sell / Referral / Tech Integration / Distribution / OEM]

They sell to: [Same ICP as you]
They're trusted by: [Your target buyers]
They do NOT compete with us: [Non-overlapping product/service]
Their business model: [Services / SaaS / Consulting / Agency / Marketplace]
Their size: [Revenue range or team size]
Their growth stage: [Startup / Scale-up / Established / Enterprise]
Their geography: [Markets they cover]

What they gain by partnering with us:
• [Benefit 1 — e.g., expanded product offering for their clients]
• [Benefit 2 — e.g., revenue share on referrals]
• [Benefit 3 — e.g., competitive differentiation]
```

### Step 2 — Map the Partner Ecosystem
Identify categories of potential partners based on what you sell:

**Category A — Adjacent Service Providers**
Companies who serve the same buyer but with non-competing services.
Examples: If you sell sales tech → partner with sales consulting firms, revenue operations agencies, and sales training companies.

**Category B — Technology Integration Partners**
Platforms your buyers already use where an integration creates mutual value.
Examples: If you sell a CRM add-on → partner with HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive as integration partners.

**Category C — Channel / Reseller Partners**
Companies that will sell your product as part of their portfolio.
Examples: VARs, MSPs, system integrators, distribution networks.

**Category D — Strategic Co-Sell Partners**
Companies who are in the same deals as you and can advocate for your inclusion.
Examples: Consulting firms, implementation partners, fractional executives.

**Category E — Referral / Affiliate Partners**
Individuals or companies who refer leads in exchange for a commission.
Examples: Industry influencers, advisors, podcast hosts, community builders.

For each category, generate a list of 5–10 named potential partner targets using web search if available.

### Step 3 — Partner Qualification Criteria
Score each potential partner on 5 dimensions (1–3 pts each):

```
| Criterion                            | 1 pt    | 2 pts   | 3 pts     |
|--------------------------------------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Sells to same ICP                    | Partial | Mostly  | Exactly   |
| Has established trust with that ICP  | Low     | Medium  | High      |
| Non-competing product                | Unclear | Adjacent| No overlap|
| Partner has capacity to execute      | Low     | Medium  | High      |
| Economic alignment (they benefit)    | Unclear | Partial | Clear fit |
```

Score 12–15 = Priority partner, approach first
Score 8–11 = Secondary partner, worth developing
Under 8 = Not ready or not the right fit

### Step 4 — Build the Partner Value Proposition
For each partner type, articulate the "why partner" message from THEIR perspective:

**For Co-Sell Partners:**
```
"When you bring [Your Company] into a deal, your clients get [outcome]. That means faster implementations, happier clients, and renewals you can count on. We share [X%] of any deal that closes through your introduction — with zero conflict on our end."
```

**For Referral Partners:**
```
"You've built trust with [ICP] — and your clients are constantly asking you about [problem you solve]. We pay [X%] for every referral that converts. There's no selling on your part — just an introduction. We do the rest."
```

**For Technology Partners:**
```
"Our integration with [Their Platform] means our shared customers get [specific benefit — e.g., 'bi-directional sync without manual data entry']. We'll co-market the integration to our combined user base, drive you new sign-ups, and help you retain customers who need this workflow."
```

**For Distribution Partners:**
```
"You already have the trust, the relationships, and the access to [market/geography]. We have the product. Together, we can offer [combined value] to your existing clients and open new revenue streams for your business."
```

### Step 5 — Outreach Sequence for Partner Conversations
Partnerships are relationships first, agreements second. Use this sequence:

**Outreach 1 — The Warm Intro Approach (preferred):**
```
Subject: [Mutual Contact] suggested I reach out

Hi [Name],

[Mutual contact] thought it would be worth us connecting — we both serve [ICP] and there might be some interesting overlap.

I'll keep this short: [Your Company] helps [ICP] [solve problem]. I've been talking to a few [partner type] companies about how we might work together — either through referrals, co-selling, or integration — and your name came up.

Would you be open to a 20-minute conversation to explore if there's a fit?

[Name]
```

**Outreach 1 — Cold Approach:**
```
Subject: Potential partnership — [Their Company] + [Your Company]

Hi [Name],

Quick context: [Your Company] helps [ICP] [solve specific problem]. I've been building our partner program and [Their Company] stood out as an obvious potential fit.

Here's why: your clients are almost certainly facing [problem], and right now [Their Company] doesn't have a solution for that. We do — and we pay partners [X%] for introductions that close.

Would a 20-minute call make sense to see if there's something here?

[Name]
```

**Follow-Up (if no reply after 7 days):**
```
Hi [Name], wanted to follow up on my note about a potential partnership. I understand if the timing isn't right — but if [ICP] is a client type you're serving and [problem] keeps coming up, I think this could be worth 20 minutes. Happy to share some details on how our program works before you commit to a call.
```

### Step 6 — Partnership Tiering Framework
Once you've identified partners, organize them:

**Tier 1 — Strategic Partners (invest heavily):**
- Deep integration or co-sell agreement
- Joint go-to-market plan
- Dedicated partner success manager
- Co-branded content and events

**Tier 2 — Active Partners (invest moderately):**
- Signed referral agreement
- Monthly check-ins
- Partner portal access
- Commission on referrals

**Tier 3 — Affiliate Network (self-serve):**
- Simple referral link or tracking code
- Automated commission payments
- No dedicated support needed

## Output Format
Deliver:
1. Ideal Partner Profile (IPP) for each partnership type sought
2. Partner Ecosystem Map (categories + named targets)
3. Partner Qualification Scorecard (for each target)
4. Partner Value Proposition (by partner type)
5. Outreach Sequence (cold and warm versions)
6. Partnership Tiering Framework

## Pro Tips
- The best partnerships start with a personal relationship, not a business agreement — invest in getting to know potential partners before pitching a formal deal
- Never build a partner program before your direct sales motion is working — partnerships amplify what's already working, they don't fix what isn't
- The #1 reason partnerships fail: no one is accountable for driving them. Assign a partner owner on both sides before signing anything.
- A co-sell partner who goes quiet for 60 days is not a partner — they're just someone who signed an agreement
- Your best partners come from your own customer base — companies who already believe in your product have the most credible referrals
