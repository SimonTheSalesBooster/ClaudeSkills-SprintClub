# Skill: Multi-Stakeholder Deal Navigator

## What This Skill Does
Maps, manages, and advances complex deals with multiple decision-makers, internal politics, and competing agendas. Builds a stakeholder management strategy, generates tailored communication for each role, and creates a political map of the organization that reveals who's driving the deal, who's blocking it, and who's watching from the sidelines.

## When to Use
- Your deal has 3+ stakeholders involved and you're struggling to coordinate
- Someone in the buying organization is blocking your deal
- You've lost visibility into what's happening internally at the prospect's company
- Your champion keeps saying "we're getting alignment" but nothing moves
- You're selling into enterprise and need to manage multiple relationships simultaneously

## Inputs Required
Before running this skill, ask the user for:
1. **Company and deal overview** — size, stage, how long in pipeline
2. **List of all stakeholders known** — name, title, what you know about their view of the deal
3. **Who your champion is** — and how strong they are (vocal advocate vs. passive fan?)
4. **Who the economic buyer is** — have you met them? What's their stance?
5. **Any known blockers or skeptics** — who's pushing back and why?
6. **What's currently holding the deal** — internal alignment, procurement, technical review, budget?

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1 — Build the Political Map
Every organization has formal authority (org chart) and informal influence (political reality). Map both:

**Political Map Template:**

```
DEAL POLITICAL MAP — [Company Name]

POWER CENTER (who actually decides):
Name: | Title: | Their Agenda: | Your Access: High/Med/Low

CHAMPION (your internal seller):
Name: | Title: | Influence Level: High/Med/Low
Willingness to advocate: Proactive / Passive / Unknown
Risk: [What could weaken their support?]

ECONOMIC BUYER:
Name: | Title: | Stance: For / Neutral / Unknown / Against
Engaged directly: Y/N | Last contact: [date]

INTERNAL BLOCKERS:
Name: | Title: | Why blocking: | Strategy to neutralize:

INFLUENCERS (shape opinion but don't decide):
Name: | Title: | What they care about:

SILENT OBSERVERS (watching but not engaged):
Name: | Title: | Worth engaging? Y/N
```

### Step 2 — Assess Stakeholder Sentiment
For each stakeholder, rate their position on two dimensions:

**Dimension 1 — Support Level:**
- Advocate (actively pushing for the deal internally)
- Supporter (positive but not vocal)
- Neutral (hasn't formed an opinion)
- Skeptic (has concerns but open to persuasion)
- Blocker (actively opposing the deal)

**Dimension 2 — Influence Level:**
- High (decision-maker or strong informal influence)
- Medium (consulted, but doesn't have final say)
- Low (affected by the decision but not involved in making it)

**Priority matrix:**
```
High Influence + Advocate → Protect and enable
High Influence + Neutral → Convert immediately (this is your biggest opportunity)
High Influence + Blocker → Engage directly and urgently — this can kill the deal
Low Influence + Advocate → Leverage as a reference inside
Low Influence + Blocker → Monitor; don't over-invest
```

### Step 3 — Neutralize Blockers
Blockers are usually motivated by one of five things:

**1. Protecting their turf (political)**
→ Make them feel included, not replaced. Reframe as expanding their mandate, not disrupting it.
```
"I want to make sure [Name]'s perspective is represented. Their experience with [area] is exactly why their input matters here. Could we get 30 minutes with them to understand their requirements?"
```

**2. Budget authority / cost concern**
→ Quantify ROI in their language. Show that the cost of NOT buying is higher.
```
"[Name]'s question about budget is fair. Here's the financial breakdown — and the business case for their team specifically."
```

**3. Risk aversion / past bad experience**
→ Reduce perceived risk. Offer a pilot, reference call, or phased approach.
```
"What would need to be true for [Name] to feel comfortable? Let's design an approach that addresses those risks upfront."
```

**4. Competing priority or initiative**
→ Align your solution to their existing initiative rather than competing with it.
```
"I understand [Name] is focused on [initiative]. I'd actually argue [our solution] directly accelerates that — here's how."
```

**5. They've already chosen a competitor**
→ Surface this early and address it directly through your champion.
```
Ask champion: "Is there someone in the process who's already leaning toward [competitor]? I want to make sure we've addressed their specific concerns directly."
```

### Step 4 — Build Tailored Communication for Each Stakeholder
Each role speaks a different language. Customize everything:

**For the Champion:**
→ Give them ammunition. They're selling for you internally.
```
"Here's a one-pager you can share with [Economic Buyer]. I've structured it around [their stated priority]. Let me know if you want me to adjust the angle."
```

**For the Economic Buyer:**
→ Speak ROI and strategic fit. Minimal features, maximum business case.
```
"The investment is $[X]. Based on what [Champion] shared about your goals, you should see [specific outcome] within [timeframe]. Happy to walk you through the numbers — it's a 15-minute conversation."
```

**For the Technical Evaluator:**
→ Specifics, documentation, and proof of security/compliance.
```
"Here's our security documentation and integration spec. I'd like to schedule 30 minutes with your team to walk through the technical architecture and answer any questions directly."
```

**For the Skeptic:**
→ Acknowledge their concern directly. Never oversell to a skeptic.
```
"I understand [Name] has some reservations — that's fair, and I'd rather address them head-on than pretend they don't exist. Can we get 20 minutes to talk through their specific concerns?"
```

**For Procurement:**
→ Reduce friction. Get ahead of their requirements before they ask.
```
"I've worked with procurement at similar companies and I know the process. Here's what they typically ask for — I've already prepared it. Happy to connect your team with ours to move this quickly."
```

### Step 5 — Design the Multi-Thread Engagement Plan
Track every stakeholder interaction in a simple plan:

```
STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT TRACKER — [Company]

| Stakeholder | Role | Last Contact | Next Action | Owner | Date |
|-------------|------|-------------|-------------|-------|------|
| [Name] | Champion | [date] | Enable with business case | AE | This week |
| [Name] | Econ. Buyer | Never | Request 15-min meeting via champion | AE | ASAP |
| [Name] | Tech Eval | [date] | Send security docs + schedule review | SE | This week |
| [Name] | Blocker | Never | Engage through champion | AE | Next week |
| [Name] | Procurement | Never | Proactively share contract templates | AE | Month 2 |
```

### Step 6 — When the Deal Goes Dark (Internal Silence)
If your champion goes quiet and the deal stops moving:

**The Honest Check-In:**
```
"[Name], I want to be transparent — I'm having trouble getting a read on where things stand internally. I'd rather know the truth, even if it's not what I'm hoping to hear. Can we get 15 minutes this week? I want to understand if this is still a priority and if there's anything I can do to help."
```

**The Temperature Check (if champion is still responsive):**
```
"On a scale of 1–10, how confident are you that this moves forward this quarter? And what would need to happen to make it a 10?"
```

**If deal has been silent for 3+ weeks with no response:**
→ Escalate via a different thread (try Economic Buyer or another stakeholder)
→ Send the "Permission to close?" message (see Deal Closer Playbook)
→ Accept the deal may be dead and allocate time accordingly

## Output Format
Deliver:
1. Political Map (completed template for the specific deal)
2. Stakeholder Sentiment Matrix (all stakeholders rated on support + influence)
3. Blocker Neutralization Strategy (for each identified blocker)
4. Tailored Communication for each stakeholder role
5. Engagement Tracker (with next action per stakeholder)
6. "Deal gone dark" response sequence

## Pro Tips
- Never assume a deal is dead just because your champion has gone quiet — internal politics move slowly. But don't wait more than 2 weeks without a check-in.
- The Economic Buyer who has never spoken to you is the biggest risk in any enterprise deal — engineer a reason to meet them before the proposal stage
- Internal champions lose influence over time if the deal drags. Help them win visible wins internally to keep their advocacy strong.
- In deals with 5+ stakeholders, ask your champion to draw you the org chart and annotate who likes what and who reports to whom — most reps never ask for this
- Your biggest competitor in complex deals isn't another vendor — it's internal inertia. Your job is to make the case for change, not just for your product.
