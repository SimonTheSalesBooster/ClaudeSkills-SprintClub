# Skill: Competitive Battle Cards

## What This Skill Does

Builds per-competitor battle cards that give sales reps instant, confident responses when a competitor is named mid-deal. Each battle card contains: where you win, where they win, how to reframe the comparison, specific displacement scripts, landmines to plant early, and what never to say. Designed for use in real conversations — short, direct, and immediately usable. A rep who knows their competitive position closes more deals and loses fewer to FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt).

## When to Use

- A prospect names a competitor on a discovery call and you need a response
- You're in a competitive evaluation and need to know how to differentiate without sounding defensive
- A prospect says "we're also talking to [Competitor]" and your rep freezes
- You want to train a new sales hire on the competitive landscape quickly
- You're losing deals to the same competitor repeatedly and want to understand why
- You want to plant landmines early in discovery that disqualify competitors before they're even mentioned

## Inputs Required

Before running this skill, ask the user for:

1. **Competitor name(s)** — which competitor(s) to build cards for (up to 3 per run for quality)
2. **Your product/service** — what do you sell, and what's the core value proposition?
3. **ICP reminder** — who is your ideal customer? (title, industry, size, pain)
4. **Known win/loss patterns** — where do you typically win against this competitor? Where do you typically lose? Even rough impressions are useful.
5. **Prospect source** — where did you hear about the competitor in this deal? (prospect mentioned it, LinkedIn research, RFP, mutual customer)
6. **Deal stage** — is the competitor being evaluated simultaneously, or is the prospect currently using the competitor and considering switching?
7. **Any known competitor strengths** — what do prospects say they like about the competitor? What does the competitor say about themselves?

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1 — Build the Competitive Profile

Research and document each competitor's public position:

**Their stated positioning:** What do they claim to be the best at? What language do they use on their website, in case studies, in sales conversations?

**Their typical buyer:** What size company, what title, what industry buys from them most? How do they differ from your ICP?

**Their business model:** Pricing model (seat-based, usage, flat), implementation complexity, support model, contract length norms.

**Their known weaknesses (public signals):**
- G2/Capterra reviews mentioning frustrations
- Common complaints in community forums or Reddit threads
- Churn patterns or customer complaints surfaced in prospect conversations
- Implementation horror stories or support complaints
- Pricing opacity or surprise costs at renewal

**Recent changes to watch:**
- Funding rounds (more aggressive sales, may cut corners on service)
- Leadership changes (instability, culture shift)
- Acquisition (integration risk, roadmap uncertainty)
- Price increases or model changes
- Customer wins or losses that signal direction

### Step 2 — Build the Where-You-Win / Where-They-Win Matrix

Be honest. A battle card that claims you win on everything is useless and trains reps to be arrogant. A good battle card acknowledges where the competitor is strong — and arms reps to handle it.

**Where You Win (your genuine advantages):**
List 4–6 areas where you consistently beat this competitor based on deal data, customer feedback, and product reality. For each advantage, state:
- The advantage
- The proof point (customer quote, metric, case study)
- The question to ask that surfaces it as a priority for the prospect

**Where They Win (their genuine advantages):**
List 2–4 areas where the competitor has a real advantage. For each:
- Acknowledge it honestly
- Provide the reframe — how you neutralize or contextualize the weakness
- What not to say (responses that make you look defensive or weak)

**Format:**

| Area | You Win | They Win | Reframe |
|---|---|---|---|
| Implementation speed | | | |
| Pricing transparency | | | |
| Enterprise integrations | | | |
| Customer support | | | |
| Product depth in [specific feature] | | | |

### Step 3 — Write the Displacement Scripts

Write word-for-word scripts for the three most common competitive moments:

**Scenario A — "We're also evaluating [Competitor]"**
Goal: Acknowledge without panic, differentiate without disparaging, plant a landmine question.

Template:
"[Competitor] is a solid option — I'd expect them to be in any evaluation like this. The main thing I'd suggest looking at closely is [specific landmine question that reveals their weakness]. Most companies at your stage find that [their weakness] becomes a real issue around [milestone or scale point]. When you're doing your evaluation, it might be worth asking them specifically about [that point]. We can show you how we handle it."

**Scenario B — "We already use [Competitor] and we're happy with them"**
Goal: Respect the relationship, identify the crack, position as an upgrade — not a replacement.

Template:
"That makes sense — they're well-established. A lot of the companies we work with came from [Competitor]. Can I ask — what's working well for you with them right now? [Listen.] And is there anything where you've hit a ceiling or wished it could do more? [Listen.] The reason I ask is that most teams we talk to are happy with [Competitor] up to a certain point — usually around [the scale or use case where they break down]. If that's not an issue for you, then great. But if [that problem] is something you're starting to feel, it might be worth a 30-minute conversation to see if the timing makes sense."

**Scenario C — "Why should we choose you over [Competitor]?"**
Goal: Give a clean, confident, non-defensive answer that reframes the comparison.

Template:
"The honest answer is: it depends on what matters most to you. If [their primary strength] is the top priority and you don't need [your differentiator], they might be the better fit. Where we consistently win is when [your ideal use case] is the priority — specifically [your 3 clearest differentiators]. For teams like yours, that tends to matter a lot because [their specific context]. The best way to find out is to run a quick side-by-side on [the specific capability that matters most to them]."

### Step 4 — Plant the Landmines Early

Landmines are questions you ask early in the sales process — before the competitor is even mentioned — that make the prospect think critically about the competitor's weaknesses when they eventually meet them.

For each competitor, write 2–3 landmine questions:

**Landmine format:** "When you're evaluating solutions like this, how important is [the thing the competitor is weak at]? Have you seen situations where [their weakness] caused issues?"

Example landmines against a competitor known for poor support:
- "How critical is it that you have access to a dedicated support person — not just a ticket queue — when you're in the middle of a live situation?"
- "Have you ever been in a situation where something broke during a key business period and support was hard to reach? What was the impact?"
- "When you're this far into a buying process, how do you evaluate whether a vendor's post-sale support matches their pre-sale promises?"

Once the prospect has answered these questions, they'll ask the competitor about it in their own evaluation — and will evaluate the answer through the lens of the concern you surfaced.

### Step 5 — Define What Not to Say

Every battle card must include a list of phrases to avoid. These are things that make reps look afraid, arrogant, or unprofessional — and they lose deals.

**Universal "never say" rules:**
- Never say the competitor's name more than once in a response — repeating it elevates them
- Never say "we're better than [Competitor]" — prospects distrust self-comparison claims
- Never attack the competitor's product without a proof point — it sounds like FUD
- Never say "I don't know much about them" — it signals you're not credible in the competitive landscape
- Never dismiss a prospect's existing relationship with a competitor — it dismisses their judgment

**Competitor-specific things not to say:** (customize per competitor)
- [Specific claim the competitor makes that you should not directly refute without proof]
- [Specific weakness of yours that the competitor will bring up — don't lead with this]

### Step 6 — Build the One-Line Response Library

Write 5–8 one-liners the rep can use in casual conversation when the competitor comes up:

- In a first call: "We respect what they've built — we just see the problem differently."
- When asked about price: "Our pricing looks different on the surface, but the TCO comparison usually tells a different story — want me to walk you through that?"
- When a prospect seems to prefer the competitor: "What do you like most about them? [Listen.] That makes sense. The teams that choose us usually care more about [your differentiator] — let me show you why that ends up mattering."
- When the competitor is the incumbent: "Switching costs are real — I'd never tell you they're not. The question is whether the cost of staying is higher than the cost of switching. That's what we should figure out together."

## Output Format

Deliver one battle card per competitor:

1. **Competitive Profile** — positioning, typical buyer, business model, known weaknesses, recent changes
2. **Win/Loss Matrix** — honest table of where you win, where they win, and the reframe for each loss area
3. **Displacement Scripts** — word-for-word scripts for scenarios A, B, and C
4. **Landmine Question Bank** — 3 questions to ask early that prime the prospect to evaluate the competitor's weakness
5. **Never Say List** — universal rules + competitor-specific phrases to avoid
6. **One-Line Response Library** — 5–8 quick responses for casual competitive mentions

## Pro Tips

- The best battle cards are built from real deal data, not product marketing guesses. After every competitive loss, debrief the rep: "What did the prospect say about why they chose [Competitor]?" That data is worth more than any analyst report.
- Reps who bash competitors lose deals. Prospects trust reps who acknowledge the competitor respectfully and then redirect with a sharp question. Confidence beats contempt every time.
- Update your battle cards every quarter. Competitors change their pricing, acquire companies, hire new heads of sales, and change their pitch. A 12-month-old battle card can actually hurt you.
- The landmine technique is the highest-ROI move in competitive selling. Planting a well-timed question in discovery changes how the prospect evaluates everyone — including you.
- When you lose to a competitor, read their G2 reviews the same week. Prospects who left them will tell you exactly what went wrong — and that intelligence is your next battle card update.
- Don't build battle cards for every competitor — build them only for the ones you lose to most often. Depth on three competitors beats shallow coverage of ten.

## Example Output Snippet

**Competitor:** Salesforce (in a deal where you offer a lighter CRM for SMB)
**Scenario:** "We're also looking at Salesforce."

**Displacement Script:**
"Salesforce is the safe choice for a lot of teams — I'd expect it to come up. The main thing I'd explore with them is what implementation looks like at your stage. Most companies your size find that the Salesforce rollout takes 3–6 months and often needs a consultant or admin hire to keep it running. When you talk to them, I'd specifically ask: 'What does a day-1 to day-30 onboarding look like, and what does our team need to own internally to make that work?' The answer usually tells you whether it's the right fit for where you are right now. We can show you what our version of that looks like — it's very different."

**Landmine (planted in discovery, 2 weeks earlier):**
"How much internal bandwidth does your team have to manage a new tool during the rollout? Have you been in situations before where a software implementation became more of a project than expected?"
