# Skill: Account Expansion Playbook

## What This Skill Does

Turns your existing customer base into a systematic upsell and cross-sell pipeline. Identifies which accounts are ready to expand, what to offer them, when to have the conversation, and exactly what to say. Outputs an expansion-ready account list with scores, expansion offers mapped to each account's situation, conversation scripts, and a 90-day expansion calendar. Expansion revenue closes 3x faster than net new, at a fraction of the acquisition cost — this skill makes it systematic rather than accidental.

## When to Use

- You have paying customers but no structured process for growing revenue from them
- Your net new pipeline is thin and you need faster revenue without more top-of-funnel spend
- A customer just hit a milestone or success moment — the perfect trigger for an expansion conversation
- You're approaching a renewal and want to use it as an expansion opportunity rather than just a retention event
- You want to build a formal expansion program into your customer success or account management process
- You're leaving money on the table — you know some customers could benefit from more, but you haven't asked

## Inputs Required

Before running this skill, ask the user for:

1. **Customer list** — names, companies, current product/tier/spend, and relationship status (healthy, neutral, at-risk)
2. **Expansion options available** — what can customers buy more of? (additional seats, higher tier, add-on modules, adjacent services, professional services, training, new product lines)
3. **Current usage data** — if available: usage levels, feature adoption, seats used vs. purchased, departments using the product, frequency of use
4. **Recent customer interactions** — notes from last call, support tickets, NPS responses, QBR outcomes, stated goals or frustrations
5. **Contract details** — renewal dates, current contract value, any unused capacity or overage patterns
6. **ICP for expansion** — which types of customers typically expand? What does an expansion-ready customer look like?

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1 — Score Every Account for Expansion Readiness

Apply the Expansion Readiness Score to each customer:

| Signal | Points |
|---|---|
| Usage is at 80%+ of purchased capacity (seats, volume, limits) | 12 pts |
| Customer reported a positive outcome or ROI in last 90 days | 10 pts |
| Customer has expanded departments or headcount since purchase | 8 pts |
| Customer asked about features they don't yet have access to | 8 pts |
| NPS 8+ or proactive positive feedback in last 60 days | 7 pts |
| Renewal is 60–120 days away | 5 pts |
| Customer referenced a new initiative or project that aligns with your other offerings | 5 pts |
| Customer has multiple internal users but only 1 paid seat | 5 pts |
| Account has grown in revenue or employees since purchase | 4 pts |

**Score 35+** = Expansion Priority — have the conversation this week
**Score 20–34** = Expansion Ready — conversation in next 30 days
**Score 10–19** = Expansion Candidate — plant seeds now, ask in 60–90 days
**Below 10** = Not yet — focus on health and adoption first

### Step 2 — Identify the Right Expansion Offer per Account

Match each account to the expansion offer most aligned to their current situation. Do not pitch the full catalog — pick one thing per account.

**Expansion type mapping:**

**Capacity Expansion (more of the same):**
Best for: customers at or near usage limits, teams that have grown since purchase
Signal: usage at 80%+, new hires, new departments using the product without licenses
Offer: "You've grown significantly since we started — are you finding that the current capacity is keeping up with where the team is now?"

**Tier Upgrade (access to more advanced features):**
Best for: customers who are asking about features they don't have, hitting a ceiling in their current plan
Signal: support tickets asking about unavailable features, work-arounds being used, stated frustrations with current limits
Offer: "Based on how you're using the product, you're actually bumping up against some limits that the next tier removes — I think it's worth a 20-minute look at whether the upgrade makes financial sense."

**Cross-Sell (different product or service):**
Best for: customers with a clear adjacent pain that your other offering solves
Signal: they mentioned a problem in a recent call that another product addresses, they're using a competitor for something adjacent
Offer: "You mentioned [adjacent pain] on our last call — we actually have a solution for exactly that. I didn't want to bring it up before you were getting value from the core product, but now that you are, it might be worth a look."

**Professional Services / Implementation:**
Best for: customers who are under-adopting, have a big initiative coming up, or want to go faster
Signal: low feature adoption despite high intent, upcoming project or launch, expressed frustration with how long things are taking internally
Offer: "You have a big push coming up — I know your team is stretched. We have a team that specializes in getting customers from where you are to where you want to be in 6 weeks. Want me to put together what that would look like?"

**Multi-Year Renewal + Expansion:**
Best for: customers approaching renewal who are healthy and happy
Signal: upcoming renewal date, high satisfaction, stated goals that require continuity
Offer: "I want to get ahead of your renewal before it's on top of us. I also think there's a conversation worth having about the roadmap — there are some capabilities coming that I think you'll want access to. Can we block 30 minutes to look at a proposal that makes sense for the next couple of years?"

### Step 3 — Find the Expansion Moment

Like referrals, expansion conversations have a right moment and a wrong moment. The right moment is always tied to a success event or a signal of need — not to a quarterly check-in or a convenient slot in the calendar.

**The best expansion triggers:**
- Customer just reported a milestone, result, or win ("we've seen X% improvement")
- Customer hit a usage ceiling for the first time (usage report shows 85%+ capacity)
- Customer's team grew — new hire announcement, LinkedIn update, company news
- Customer mentioned a new project or initiative that connects to your other offerings
- Renewal is 90 days out (proactive, not reactive)
- Customer just completed onboarding with a positive outcome

**The worst times to expand:**
- Customer is currently experiencing a problem or support issue (fix it first)
- Customer has gone quiet and you're not sure why
- End of your quarter — it reads as pressure, not partnership
- You haven't spoken in more than 60 days — re-establish the relationship first

For each expansion-ready account, identify which trigger has occurred most recently. That's the opening.

### Step 4 — Write the Expansion Conversation Scripts

Write a specific opening for each type of expansion trigger. These should feel like natural check-in conversations — not sales calls.

**After a success moment:**
"[Name] — really glad to hear about [specific result or milestone]. That's exactly the kind of outcome we were hoping for when we started. It made me want to reach out, actually — now that [core use case] is working well, there are one or two things I've seen other teams at your stage unlock next that tend to compound those results. Is it worth 20 minutes for me to walk you through what that might look like for you specifically?"

**After usage hits a ceiling:**
"[Name] — I was looking at your account and noticed you've hit about [X]% of your capacity. I wanted to flag it before it becomes a bottleneck rather than after. Want to look at options together? There's a pretty straightforward path that most teams in your position take."

**After a team growth signal:**
"[Name] — congratulations on the new [hire / team expansion / office]. Growing teams usually mean more pressure on [the thing you solve]. I wanted to check in and make sure the setup you have still makes sense for where you're headed."

**Ahead of renewal:**
"[Name] — your renewal is coming up in about 90 days and I want to be proactive rather than reactive about it. I also have some ideas on how to set the team up better for next year based on how you've been using things. Can we find 30 minutes before the renewal hits?"

### Step 5 — Handle the Common Expansion Objections

**"We're not ready to expand right now."**
"That makes sense. Can I ask what 'ready' looks like for you? Is it a specific outcome, a budget cycle, or something internal that needs to align first? I want to make sure I'm coming back at the right moment — not too early, not too late."

**"We'd need to get budget approved."**
"Understood. Who would need to be involved in that conversation? Sometimes I can help by putting together a business case that makes it easier internally. Would that be useful?"

**"We need to see more value from what we already have first."**
"That's a completely fair bar. What would 'seeing more value' look like — is there a specific result or milestone you're watching for? If I know what that is, I can focus on making sure we hit it, and then we can revisit this conversation."

**"We're happy with what we have."**
"I'm really glad to hear that — genuinely. I'm not trying to change something that's working. I'm just flagging one thing that I've seen a few teams miss until it becomes a bigger problem: [specific capability gap or usage ceiling]. Is that even on your radar?"

### Step 6 — Build the 90-Day Expansion Calendar

For each expansion-priority account, map out a 90-day sequence:

**Days 1–7:** Have the opening expansion conversation (script from Step 4). Goal: gauge interest and identify the right expansion offer.

**Days 8–21:** Send supporting material if interest is confirmed (ROI snapshot, upgrade overview, case study from similar company). Follow up once after 5 days if no response.

**Days 22–45:** Proposal or upgrade offer sent. If budget or approval is needed, ask for the internal process and offer to support with a business case.

**Days 46–75:** Navigate internal process. Stay in contact with champion (use Champion Builder skill if needed). Address objections as they arise.

**Days 76–90:** Close the expansion or agree on a specific future date. Never let it drift open-ended — always get a clear next step or a clear "not this cycle."

## Output Format

Deliver:

1. **Expansion-Ready Account List** — all accounts scored and ranked by Expansion Readiness Score
2. **Expansion Offer Map** — for each priority account, the specific expansion offer matched to their situation and signals
3. **Expansion Trigger Log** — for each account, the most recent signal or trigger that makes now the right time
4. **Conversation Scripts** — tailored opening scripts per account based on their trigger type
5. **Objection Responses** — pre-written responses to the 4 most common expansion objections
6. **90-Day Expansion Calendar** — week-by-week plan for each priority account through to close or next decision point

## Pro Tips

- Your best expansion accounts are the ones already using the product daily. Before reaching out, check usage data — a customer who logs in twice a month isn't ready for an expansion conversation yet.
- Never pitch expansion on the same call where a customer brings up a problem. Solve the problem first. Then, on the next touch, bring up expansion. Trying to upsell someone who's frustrated tells them you care more about revenue than their success.
- The best expansion conversations don't feel like sales conversations. They feel like a trusted advisor noticing something and flagging it. Your job is to make the prospect feel seen, not sold to.
- Cross-sell works best when you've already earned credibility with the core product. The question to ask yourself before any cross-sell: "Does this customer trust us enough to buy something new from us?" If the answer is no, invest in that trust before bringing out a new offer.
- Multi-year deals are the highest-leverage expansion move. A 2-year deal at the same ACV is better than a 1-year deal — it removes the renewal risk, improves your revenue visibility, and usually comes with a small price increase that feels fair to the customer because they're getting rate certainty.
- Build expansion KPIs into your customer success team: Net Revenue Retention (NRR) target, expansion pipeline value, average expansion deal size. What gets measured gets managed.

## Example Output Snippet

**Account:** BrightOps Agency | Current MRR: $2,400 | Expansion Score: 38 — Priority
**Trigger:** Usage hit 87% of seat capacity last month; team grew by 4 people according to LinkedIn
**Expansion Offer:** Seat expansion (next tier adds 10 seats + removes the monthly report limit)

**Opening Script:**
"Hi Sarah — I was looking at your account this week and noticed you're at about 87% of your seat capacity, which usually means teams are starting to feel the squeeze. I also saw on LinkedIn that you've added a few people recently — congrats on the growth. I wanted to flag it before it becomes a bottleneck. There's a straightforward upgrade path that adds 10 seats and also removes the monthly report limit, which I suspect you're going to hit soon too. Want to jump on a quick call to look at the numbers together? I can put together a comparison that makes it easy to see whether it makes sense."
