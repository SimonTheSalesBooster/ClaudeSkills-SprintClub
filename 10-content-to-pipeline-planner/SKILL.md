# Skill: Content-to-Pipeline Planner

## What This Skill Does
Creates a LinkedIn content strategy that directly feeds pipeline — not vanity metrics. Maps content topics to ICP pain points, plans a 4-week publishing calendar, and builds a system for turning post engagement into sales conversations without being pushy.

## When to Use
- You want LinkedIn content to generate leads, not just likes
- You're posting but not seeing any pipeline from it
- You want a repeatable monthly content system
- You want to attract inbound interest from prospects before they're even in your pipeline

## Inputs Required
Before running this skill, ask the user for:
1. **ICP** — who they're trying to reach (title, industry, pain points)
2. **Core offer** — what they sell and the problem it solves
3. **Content comfort level** — how comfortable are they writing/posting? Any existing content?
4. **Posting goal** — awareness, leads, thought leadership, or all three?
5. **Time available for content** — how many hours/week?

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1 — Define the Content Pillars
Build 3–4 content pillars that are directly connected to ICP pain points and purchasing decisions:

**Pillar Framework:**
```
Pillar 1 — INSIGHT (Authority Builder)
Purpose: Show you understand the problem better than anyone else
Topics: Data, observations, counterintuitive takes on industry problems
Example: "Why most [title] are solving [problem] backwards"

Pillar 2 — STORY (Trust Builder)
Purpose: Show that you've helped people like them get results
Topics: Customer stories (anonymized or named), before/after scenarios, lessons learned
Example: "How a [Company type] went from [pain state] to [outcome] in [timeframe]"

Pillar 3 — EDUCATION (Value Provider)
Purpose: Give them something actionable they can use today
Topics: Frameworks, how-tos, checklists, step-by-step processes
Example: "The 5-step process we use to [solve the problem you solve]"

Pillar 4 — OPINION (Conversation Starter)
Purpose: Attract comments and engagement from your ICP
Topics: Contrarian views, hot takes, "unpopular opinions" on your industry
Example: "Controversial take: [belief that your ICP will react to]"
```

### Step 2 — Build the 4-Week Content Calendar

**Recommended posting frequency:** 3x per week (Mon/Wed/Fri or Tue/Thu + 1 weekend)

**Week 1:**
| Day | Pillar | Topic | Format |
|-----|--------|-------|--------|
| Monday | Insight | [ICP-specific data point or observation] | Text post with hook |
| Wednesday | Story | [Customer result or case study] | Narrative post |
| Friday | Opinion | [Contrarian take on ICP's challenge] | Poll or question |

**Week 2:**
| Day | Pillar | Topic | Format |
|-----|--------|-------|--------|
| Monday | Education | [How-to or framework] | Carousel or numbered list |
| Wednesday | Insight | [Trend or pattern you're seeing] | Text post |
| Friday | Story | [Lesson learned / failure story] | Personal narrative |

**Week 3:**
| Day | Pillar | Topic | Format |
|-----|--------|-------|--------|
| Monday | Opinion | [Hot take relevant to ICP] | Debate-style post |
| Wednesday | Education | [Step-by-step process or checklist] | Text or carousel |
| Friday | Insight | [Benchmark data or observation] | Data-driven post |

**Week 4:**
| Day | Pillar | Topic | Format |
|-----|--------|-------|--------|
| Monday | Story | [Win story with specific outcome metrics] | Result-focused post |
| Wednesday | Opinion | [Something counterintuitive you've learned] | Bold statement post |
| Friday | Education | [Common mistake + how to fix it] | Problem/solution post |

### Step 3 — The LinkedIn Post Formula
Every post should follow this proven structure:

```
LINE 1: The Hook (make them stop scrolling)
— Bold claim, surprising stat, counterintuitive statement, or provocative question
— Examples: "Most [title] are wasting 30% of their outreach budget."
            "I used to think [common belief]. I was completely wrong."
            "Here's what nobody tells you about [topic]:"

[BLANK LINE — forces "see more" click on mobile]

LINES 2–8: The Body (deliver the value)
— 3–5 short bullets or paragraphs
— Each line should be punchy and scannable
— Use white space generously
— Build to a conclusion

[BLANK LINE]

LINE 9: The CTA (invite action)
— A question to drive comments: "What's your experience with this?"
— A soft offer: "I wrote a full breakdown on this — want me to share it?"
— A meeting path: "If this is a problem for you too, drop a comment or DM me."
```

### Step 4 — The Engagement-to-Conversation System
Turn post likes and comments into sales conversations without being spammy:

**When someone likes your post:**
```
Wait 24 hours, then DM:
"Hey [Name], saw you liked my post on [topic] — glad it resonated. Curious, is [topic] something you're dealing with at [Company] right now?"
```
→ If yes: Move to Prospect Research Brief skill and start outreach flow
→ If no reply: No follow-up, let it be

**When someone comments on your post:**
```
Reply to their comment publicly first (builds credibility for others watching).
Then DM:
"Hey [Name], love your perspective on [their comment point]. You clearly think about this — are you open to a quick exchange? I've got some thoughts on [related insight] that might be useful for you."
```

**When someone views your profile after seeing your post:**
```
Connection request:
"Hi [Name], noticed you checked out my profile — probably from my post on [topic]. Would love to connect, especially if [topic] is something you're working on."
```

### Step 5 — Content-to-Pipeline Metrics Dashboard
Track these metrics weekly to know what's working:

```
CONTENT PIPELINE TRACKER — Week of [Date]

CONTENT METRICS:
Posts published: [X] / 3 target
Total impressions: [X]
Average engagement rate: [X]% (healthy = 2–5%)
Comments from ICP: [X]
Profile views from posts: [X]

PIPELINE METRICS:
Post-engagement DMs sent: [X]
DM reply rate: [X]%
New conversations started: [X]
Discovery calls booked from content: [X]
Pipeline value generated: $[X]

TOP PERFORMING POST THIS WEEK:
Topic: [...]
Why it worked: [...]
Repeat format: [Yes/No]
```

### Step 6 — Monthly Content-to-Pipeline Review
At the end of each month, answer:
1. Which pillar drove the most engagement? → Post more of it
2. Which post type started the most conversations? → Double down
3. How much pipeline was sourced from content? → Track as a channel
4. What topics got the most comments from ICP titles? → These are content goldmines

## Output Format
Deliver:
1. 4 Content Pillars (customized to ICP and offer)
2. 4-Week Content Calendar (ready to execute)
3. Post Formula Template (with examples)
4. Engagement-to-Conversation Playbook (3 DM scenarios)
5. Monthly Content-to-Pipeline Tracking Dashboard

## Pro Tips
- One great post per week beats three mediocre ones — quality over frequency always
- The hook is 80% of the battle — if the first line doesn't stop the scroll, nothing else matters
- Write FOR one specific person (your ideal prospect) — not for everyone
- Story posts consistently outperform tips/advice posts — people remember narratives, not frameworks
- Comments from non-ICP prospects are vanity; comments from ICP prospects are pipeline signals
- Build content as a long game: consistency over 6–12 months compounds dramatically — most people quit after 4 weeks
