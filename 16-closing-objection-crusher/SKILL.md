# Skill: Closing Objection Crusher

## What This Skill Does
Diagnoses every late-stage sales objection — real and smokescreen — and generates a precise, non-manipulative response that moves the deal forward. Covers pricing, timing, competition, internal politics, risk, and "we need to think about it" stalls. Turns objections into closing moments.

## When to Use
- A deal is stuck because of a specific objection you don't know how to handle
- You hear the same objection repeatedly and need a better response
- You want to prepare objection scripts before a big closing meeting
- A prospect went quiet and you suspect an unspoken objection
- You need to train a rep on objection handling

## Inputs Required
Before running this skill, ask the user for:
1. **The exact objection** — their words, as close to verbatim as possible
2. **Context** — deal stage, size, who said it, when
3. **What you've already tried** — what responses have you given so far?
4. **Your gut sense** — do you think this objection is the real issue, or is there something deeper?

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1 — Classify the Objection
Before responding, diagnose what type of objection it is:

**Type A — Real Objection (must be resolved to close)**
They have a genuine concern that, if resolved, would allow them to move forward.
Signs: Specific, consistent, came up early in the process.

**Type B — Condition (not a negotiation, but a requirement)**
Something that genuinely must exist for them to buy (budget, approval, timing).
Signs: Not flexible, tied to external constraints outside their control.

**Type C — Smokescreen (hiding the real issue)**
They're not comfortable sharing the real concern, so they use a placeholder.
Signs: Vague, sudden, appeared only when you asked for the business.

**Type D — Delay Tactic (they're not ready to decide)**
They like the solution but aren't committing — using objections to buy time.
Signs: Keeps shifting, new objections appear after each one is resolved.

### Step 2 — The Universal Objection Response Framework

For any objection, use this 4-step structure:

```
1. ACKNOWLEDGE (don't argue, don't fold)
   "That's a fair point / I hear you / I appreciate you sharing that."

2. CLARIFY (find the real concern)
   "Help me understand — [specific question about the objection]"

3. ISOLATE (confirm it's the only thing standing in the way)
   "If we can resolve [this concern] — is there anything else that would prevent you from moving forward?"

4. RESOLVE (address it directly, then re-close)
   [Handle the objection] → "Does that address your concern? If so, I'd like to move forward today."
```

### Step 3 — Full Objection Library with Response Scripts

**"It's too expensive / Your price is too high"**
```
Clarify: "Too expensive compared to what — a competitor, your budget, or the expected ROI?"

If vs. competitor: "Help me understand what they're offering. I want to make sure you're comparing accurately — sometimes similar-looking solutions have very different total costs."

If vs. budget: "What's the investment you had in mind? Let me see if there's a structure that works."

If vs. ROI: "Let me show you the math — [business case]. At [price], you break even in [timeframe]. Does the ROI justify the investment?"

Isolate: "If we can get to the right number or structure, is there anything else in the way?"
```

**"We need to think about it"**
```
"Of course — I want you to make the right decision. Can I ask: what specifically do you need to think through? I want to make sure I've given you everything you need."

→ If they give a specific: Handle it directly.
→ If they're vague: "I hear you. In my experience when someone says that, it usually means one of three things: there's a concern they haven't shared, the timing isn't right, or they're not sure about [value/fit/risk]. Which of those is closest to what's going on?"
```

**"The timing isn't right"**
```
"I understand — timing is everything. Help me understand what's making the timing challenging: is it budget, bandwidth, competing priorities, or something else?"

→ If budget cycle: "When does your next budget cycle open? I'd like to hold your spot and resume the conversation then. Can we put a date on the calendar?"

→ If bandwidth: "What if we structured the implementation to start [later date] while locking in today's pricing? That way you get the timing you need without losing the deal terms."

→ If no urgency: "Help me understand — what changes in [3/6/12] months that makes this easier? I ask because the problem [you described] is costing you [X] every month we wait."
```

**"We're going with a competitor"**
```
"I respect that — I'd rather you make the best decision for your business than the one I want. Can I ask one question? What made [competitor] the right choice? I want to understand where we fell short."

→ Listen carefully — if it's price: see pricing objection.
→ If it's a feature: "That feature is [on our roadmap / available via X]. Would that change your decision?"
→ If it's a relationship: "Is there any flexibility if I can [offer something specific]?"
→ If it's final: "I understand. Can I stay in touch? These decisions sometimes change — and if it's ever the right time to revisit, I'd love to be the first call."
```

**"We don't have budget"**
```
"Thanks for being direct — I appreciate that. Is it no budget at all this quarter, or a specific amount that doesn't reach our pricing?"

→ If truly no budget: "When does budget open up? I'll stay close, and in the meantime, can I get you what you need to make an easy case when it does?"

→ If insufficient budget: "What if we started with [smaller scope] that fits within your current budget and expanded once results are proven? Would that be a way in?"

→ If budget exists but isn't allocated: "Who would need to approve reallocating budget for this? Would it help if I put together a business case you could share internally?"
```

**"We need to get approval from [someone else]"**
```
"Of course — let's make that easy. Who else needs to be part of this? I want to make sure their questions are answered before we ask them to weigh in. Can we get [person] on a call this week?"

If they resist: "I understand — can I at least put together a one-page summary they can review? That way you go into the conversation with the right materials."
```

**"I'm worried about [implementation / risk / switching cost]"**
```
"That's a legitimate concern — and it's one I want to address head-on. [Acknowledge the risk.] Here's how we've handled this for similar companies: [specific proof point or case study]. We also have [guarantee / pilot / phased approach / dedicated onboarding]. Would that reduce the risk enough for you to feel comfortable?"
```

**"We've had bad experiences with vendors like you"**
```
"I really appreciate you sharing that — it helps me understand what you've been through. Can you tell me more about what went wrong? [Listen carefully.] I want to show you specifically how we're different — not just tell you. Here's what I'd propose: [pilot / reference call / specific accountability structure]."
```

**"Your contract is too long / terms are too restrictive"**
```
"Let's look at the specific terms that concern you. What would you like to see changed? I'd rather have a direct conversation about this now than let it slow us down later. In most cases we have more flexibility than the standard agreement suggests."
```

### Step 4 — Handle Objections That Keep Reappearing
If the same objection comes back after you've addressed it:

```
"[Name], I feel like we keep coming back to [objection]. I want to be honest with you — I'm not sure I'm hearing the full picture. What's really going on? I'd rather know the truth than keep going in circles."
```

This direct approach surfaces hidden objections faster than any script.

### Step 5 — Objection Prevention Strategy
The best objection handling happens before the objection is raised:

**Pre-empt in discovery:**
"Some companies worry about [common objection] when they evaluate solutions like ours. Is that something on your mind?"

**Pre-empt at proposal:**
"Before I walk you through the proposal, I want to make sure we've addressed everything that could slow us down. [Name] usually comes up — let's talk about that now so it doesn't surprise us later."

**Inoculation close:**
"I know procurement is going to push back on price — that's their job. Here's the business case I'd recommend they see. Want to walk through it together?"

## Output Format
Deliver:
1. Objection Classification (what type of objection is this?)
2. Targeted Response Script (using the 4-step framework)
3. Clarifying question to uncover the real concern
4. Isolating question to confirm it's the only blocker
5. Pre-emptive language to prevent this objection in future deals

## Pro Tips
- The best response to any objection is a question — not an answer
- Most late-stage objections are about risk, not logic. Address emotion before facts.
- If you've handled the same objection 3+ times without closing, you have a positioning problem, not an objection problem
- Objections that appear only when you ask for the business are almost always smokescreens — go deeper
- Never talk past a close: if they say yes after you handle an objection, stop talking and send the contract
